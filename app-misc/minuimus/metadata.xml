    <longdescription>Minuimus is a file optimiser utility script: You point it at a file, and it
        makes the file smaller without compromising the file contents. File optimisers are able to
        do this using a variety of file-specfic optimisations, most of which involve decompressing
        data within a compressed file and recompressing it in a more efficient manner. The process
        could be compared directly to extracting a ZIP file, then recompressing it at the most
        demanding setting. It uses many of the same techniques used by other optimisers such as
        Papa's Best Optimizer.</longdescription>
