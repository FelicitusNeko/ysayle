## Wish list

- Missing packages ­— as far as I know, these don't exist on any repo
  - Bizhawk
  - Chatty (Twitch chat client)
  - F-Chat Horizon
  - Fightcade
  - Imageboard Grabber
  - OpenDeck
  - Ruffle nightly
  - XIVLauncher.Core RankynBass fork
- Packages to improve
  - `games-util/poptracker`
    - Not keyworded because it uses `git-r3.eclass`, necessary due to submodules
